# Creating Jira Subtasks

Create or reconcile Jira subtasks for a clarified task plan at
`docs/<TICKET_KEY>-tasks.md`. This skill coordinates Phase 4 by dispatching one
specialist subagent, keeping only its structured summary, and reporting the
outcome the parent workflow needs for progress tracking.

The orchestrator does four things directly: read its bundled files, derive
identifiers from `JIRA_URL`, dispatch `subtask-creator`, and relay the
subagent's summary. Plan parsing, Jira operations, and plan-file edits all stay
inside `subtask-creator` after dispatch.

## Inputs

| Input      | Required | Example                                                     |
| ---------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `JIRA_URL` | Yes      | `https://workspace.atlassian.net/browse/PROJ-123` |

Derive these values from the URL when you need to describe the ticket:

- **Workspace:** subdomain before `.atlassian.net`
- **Project:** prefix before the dash in the ticket key
- **Ticket key:** full path segment, such as `PROJ-123`

Prefer passing the full `JIRA_URL` downstream rather than only `TICKET_KEY`.
The URL carries the workspace context needed for Jira reads and writes.

## Workflow Overview

```text
1. Read the subtask-creator definition
2. Dispatch it with JIRA_URL
3. Interpret its structured result
4. Report only the concise phase summary to the caller
```

## Subagent Registry

Read a subagent definition only when you are about to dispatch it.

| Subagent          | Path                             | Purpose                                               |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `subtask-creator` | `./subagents/subtask-creator.md` | Reconcile the clarified plan with Jira and return a structured Phase 4 summary |

## How This Skill Works

This skill is intentionally narrow. The parent workflow is responsible for
Phase 4 gating and progress tracking; this skill assumes the Phase 3 approval
step has already happened before Jira writes begin.

Inside Phase 4, keep only the routing verdicts plus the caller-facing rollup.
For Jira, that means the parent / artifact identifiers, creation totals,
warnings or failures, and the linkage rollup the caller needs for progress
tracking. Jira stays on the single native subtask path, so no write-model or
capability metadata is expected in the summary.

Relay only the structured fields the subagent returns. Raw Jira payloads, full
API responses, raw file contents, and intermediate parse details stay inside
`subtask-creator` unless the user explicitly asks for them.

## Phase 4 Contract

Primary artifact:

```text
docs/<TICKET_KEY>-tasks.md
```

For the complete standalone input contract, output contract, and summary-field
definitions, read `./references/phase-4-io-contracts.md`.

That bundled reference file is the only normative Phase 4 contract source for
this skill. `SKILL.md` covers dispatch, routing, and reporting only. The
subagent defines how to achieve the contract but does not replace it.

## Execution Steps

### 1. Dispatch `subtask-creator`

Read `./subagents/subtask-creator.md`, then dispatch it with:

- `JIRA_URL`

The subagent owns plan parsing, Jira-capable tool discovery, parent lookup,
idempotent reuse of existing subtask links, sequential creation of missing
subtasks, plan-file updates, and post-write validation.

### 2. Interpret the structured result

Handle the returned summary this way:

- `SUBTASKS: PASS` with `Validation: PASS`: report success and proceed.
- `SUBTASKS: WARN` with `Validation: PASS`: report partial success or degraded
  input clearly. Phase 4 may still be usable if the plan file now satisfies the
  local Phase 4 output contract, but make failed tasks visible so the user can
  retry before executing them.
- `SUBTASKS: BLOCKED`: stop and relay the artifact or data-shape problem. This
  usually means the plan is missing, malformed, or contains unsafe existing
  Jira links that need manual correction.
- `SUBTASKS: FAIL`: stop and relay the fatal Jira or validation failure.
- `SUBTASKS: ERROR`: stop and relay the unexpected failure.
- Any result paired with `Validation: FAIL`: treat the phase as incomplete even
  if some Jira writes succeeded, because the local plan contract is not
  trustworthy yet.
- Any result paired with `Validation: NOT_RUN`: treat the phase as incomplete;
  no trustworthy local post-write artifact was produced for downstream use.

### 3. Report only the summary

Using only the subagent's structured summary, tell the caller:

- Use the subagent summary as routing input; do not rewrite its contract schema
  inside `SKILL.md`.
- Surface the caller-facing rollup: parent reference, explicit `TICKET_KEY`,
  updated plan-file path, creation totals, warnings or failures, and the
  reminder that no implementation has started.
- Do not add GitHub-style write-model or capability lines to the Jira report.

Dispatch `subtask-creator` as a subagent. If the environment cannot invoke
subagents, report the skill as blocked rather than reproducing the subagent
inline.

## Example

<example>
Input: `JIRA_URL=https://workspace.atlassian.net/browse/PROJ-123`

1. Read `./subagents/subtask-creator.md`
2. Dispatch `subtask-creator` with `JIRA_URL`
3. Subagent returns the contract-defined summary from
   `./references/phase-4-io-contracts.md`, for example:

   SUBTASKS: PASS
   Validation: PASS
   Parent: PROJ-123
   TICKET_KEY: PROJ-123
   Plan file: docs/PROJ-123-tasks.md
   ...

4. Route on that summary, then relay only the caller-facing rollup. Do not add
   GitHub-style write-path metadata to the Jira report.
</example>

## Escalation

Use the subagent's structured verdict as the only routing input:

| Summary state | Orchestrator action |
| ------------- | ------------------ |
| `SUBTASKS: PASS` with `Validation: PASS` | Report success and proceed |
| `SUBTASKS: WARN` with `Validation: PASS` | Report usable output with warnings and make failed or skipped linkage visible |
| `SUBTASKS: BLOCKED` | Stop and surface the plan-shape or unsafe-linkage issue |
| `SUBTASKS: FAIL` | Stop and surface the fatal Jira or validation failure |
| `SUBTASKS: ERROR` or `Validation: FAIL` | Stop and surface the unexpected failure or local contract failure |

Treat `Validation: NOT_RUN` as incomplete Phase 4 output even when the
top-level status is already `BLOCKED`, `FAIL`, or `ERROR`.
