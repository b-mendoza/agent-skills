# Planning Jira Tasks

Plan a Jira ticket into a structured execution artifact at
`docs/<TICKET_KEY>-tasks.md`. This skill is the Phase 2 orchestrator in the
Jira workflow: it dispatches specialist subagents, validates each artifact
boundary, preserves planning artifacts for resume and critique, and returns
only concise handoff summaries to the parent workflow. It does not decompose
work, prioritize dependencies, or validate plan quality inline.

**Compatibility:** Downstream phases already use `TICKET_KEY`, so no alias is
required. All artifact paths use `docs/<TICKET_KEY>…`.

## Inputs

| Input        | Required | Example               |
| ------------ | -------- | --------------------- |
| `TICKET_KEY` | Yes      | `JNS-6065`            |
| `RE_PLAN`    | No       | `true`                |
| `DECISIONS`  | No       | `SSO decision changes task dependencies` |

Phase 2 is file-driven, so `TICKET_KEY` is sufficient. `JIRA_URL` is not
required once the ticket snapshot already exists on disk.

The ticket snapshot must already exist at `docs/<TICKET_KEY>.md` with these
sections, produced by `fetching-jira-ticket`:

| Required section         | Why it matters                              |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| `## Description`         | Primary source for identifying work items   |
| `## Acceptance Criteria` | Maps to Definition of Done per task         |
| `## Comments`            | Captures scope changes and clarifications   |
| `## Subtasks`            | Prevents duplicate planning                 |
| `## Linked Issues`       | Preserves dependency awareness              |

Stable context sections (`## Metadata`, `## Retrieval Warnings`, `## Attachments`,
`## Custom Fields`) are also required by the `stage-validator` preflight and are
produced by `fetching-jira-ticket` even when empty.

If any are missing, treat Phase 1 as incomplete and stop with a preflight
failure.

If `RE_PLAN=true`, reuse the same `TICKET_KEY`, load
`./references/re-plan-cycle.md`, and pass the supplied `DECISIONS` only to the
stages that need plan revisions.

This skill is self-contained at runtime. Use this file plus the co-located
`references/` and `subagents/` files as the full execution contract. Treat the
documented upstream snapshot artifact and parent workflow handoff as inputs,
not as external runtime specs.

## Output Contract

### Artifact contract

Final artifact path: `docs/<TICKET_KEY>-tasks.md`

The final plan must contain all of these sections for downstream phases:

| Section                               | Consumed by                                                         |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `## Ticket Summary`                   | `clarifying-assumptions`                                            |
| `## Execution Order Summary`          | `creating-jira-subtasks`                                            |
| `## Problem Framing`                  | `clarifying-assumptions`, critique paths                            |
| `## Assumptions and Constraints`      | `clarifying-assumptions`                                            |
| `## Cross-Cutting Open Questions`     | `clarifying-assumptions`                                            |
| `## Tasks` marker section plus separate `## Task N` headings | `clarifying-assumptions`, `creating-jira-subtasks`, task execution |
| `## Dependency Graph`                 | task execution and critique                                         |
| `## Validation Report`               | `clarifying-assumptions`                                            |

Each final task entry must include these eight subsections:

- `**Objective:**`
- `**Relevant requirements and context:**`
- `**Questions to answer before starting:**`
- `**Implementation notes:**`
- `**Definition of done:**`
- `**Likely files / artifacts affected:**`
- `**Dependencies / prerequisites:**`
- `**Priority:**`

Add `**Dependency rationale:**` immediately after
`**Dependencies / prerequisites:**` when a dependency relationship needs a
short explanation for downstream execution or review.

Phase 2 does not add `## Decisions Log`; that artifact is appended later by
Phase 3.

### Return handoff

Return only a concise phase handoff to the parent orchestrator:

Return `PLANNING: PASS` only when `PLAN: PASS`, `PRIORITIZATION: PASS`,
`TASK_VALIDATION: PASS`, and every `STAGE_VALIDATION` gate returned `PASS`.

```text
PLANNING: PASS | FAIL
Ticket: <TICKET_KEY>
File: <final file path or "not written">
Tasks: <N>
Cross-cutting questions: <N>
Validation warnings: <N>
Failure category: PREFLIGHT | STAGE_1 | STAGE_2 | STAGE_3 | POSTPIPELINE | NONE
Reason: <one line>
Artifacts preserved: <comma-separated paths>
```

Each stage writes a Category A orchestration artifact that stays on disk for
Phase 3 critique, targeted retries, and workflow resume:

| Stage | File                                | Produced by            |
| ----- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| 1     | `docs/<TICKET_KEY>-stage-1-detailed.md`    | `task-planner`         |
| 2     | `docs/<TICKET_KEY>-stage-2-prioritized.md` | `dependency-prioritizer` |
| 3     | `docs/<TICKET_KEY>-tasks.md`               | `task-validator`       |

Preserve these planning artifacts on disk. They support resume and critique
workflows, and they stay out of git history as orchestration artifacts.

## Subagent Registry

| Subagent                 | Path                                    | Purpose                                               |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `task-planner`           | `./subagents/task-planner.md`           | Decompose the ticket and draft the stage 1 plan       |
| `dependency-prioritizer` | `./subagents/dependency-prioritizer.md` | Annotate dependencies and determine execution order   |
| `task-validator`         | `./subagents/task-validator.md`         | Validate the prioritized plan and append QA findings  |
| `stage-validator`        | `./subagents/stage-validator.md`        | Check preflight, inter-stage, and final output gates  |

Read a subagent definition only when you are about to dispatch that subagent.
Do not read the stage artifacts inline unless a validator or subagent contract
explicitly requires it.

## How This Skill Works

This skill does exactly three things:

- **Dispatch** the planning subagents in sequence.
- **Validate** each artifact boundary with `stage-validator`.
- **Report** only stage verdicts and summary counts to the parent workflow.

The orchestrator keeps only decision-relevant handoff data between stages:

- The stage subagent status summary (`PLAN`, `PRIORITIZATION`, or `TASK_VALIDATION`)
- The validator verdict
- The output file path for the passing stage
- The specific issues that failed the current gate
- Retry count for the current gate

Do not carry raw plan content forward in the orchestrator context.

## Phase Guide

Execution order lives in `## Execution Steps`. Use this table as the gate and
recovery map when deciding which stage to dispatch or retry next.

| Phase / gate    | Dispatch                              | Required output                         | On failure |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| `preflight`     | `stage-validator`                     | Phase 1 snapshot document is present and complete | Stop with `Failure category: PREFLIGHT` |
| Stage 1         | `task-planner` → `stage-validator`    | `PLAN: PASS` and `docs/<TICKET_KEY>-stage-1-detailed.md` passes Stage 1 checks | Stop on `PLAN: FAIL | BLOCKED | ERROR`; retry Stage 1 only on a Stage 1 gate failure |
| Stage 2         | `dependency-prioritizer` → `stage-validator` | `PRIORITIZATION: PASS` and `docs/<TICKET_KEY>-stage-2-prioritized.md` passes Stage 2 checks | Stop on `PRIORITIZATION: FAIL | BLOCKED | ERROR`; retry Stage 2 only on a Stage 2 gate failure |
| Stage 3         | `task-validator` → `stage-validator`  | `TASK_VALIDATION: PASS` and `docs/<TICKET_KEY>-tasks.md` passes Stage 3 checks | Stop on `TASK_VALIDATION: FAIL | BLOCKED | ERROR`; retry Stage 3 only on a Stage 3 gate failure |
| `postpipeline`  | `stage-validator`                     | Final downstream contract is intact     | Re-dispatch Stage 3, then re-run Stage 3 and post-pipeline gates |

## Execution Paths

Use one of these paths:

- **Normal path:** `preflight → stage 1 → stage 2 → stage 3 → postpipeline`
- **Re-plan path:** read `./references/re-plan-cycle.md`, identify the earliest
  affected stage, resume from that stage using the preserved on-disk artifacts,
  then rerun every downstream stage and finish with `postpipeline`

Use targeted fix loops only. When a gate fails, re-dispatch the stage that
produced the failing artifact, pass only the validator's issues list, and
re-run only the failing gate. Do not restart already-passing stages unless the
re-plan rules require it.

## Execution Steps

1. **Choose execution path**
   - If `RE_PLAN` is absent or `false`, run the normal path.
   - If `RE_PLAN=true`, read `./references/re-plan-cycle.md`, determine the
     earliest affected stage, and resume from that point using the on-disk
     artifacts from the prior run.
   - Stop after 3 critique-driven re-plan iterations and escalate instead of
     looping indefinitely.
   - Start at **Stage 1** when the critique changes ticket interpretation,
     scope, assumptions, or task decomposition.
   - Start at **Stage 2** when the stage 1 task content is still valid but
     ordering, dependencies, or priority need to change.
   - Start at **Stage 3** when only the final validated artifact or report
     needs correction.
   - After rerunning the earliest affected stage, rerun every downstream stage
     and finish with the post-pipeline gate. Skip preflight on a re-plan unless
     the ticket snapshot itself changed or must be revalidated.

2. **Preflight**
   Read the `stage-validator` definition and dispatch it with:
   - `TICKET_KEY=<TICKET_KEY>`
   - `STAGE=preflight`
   - `FILE_PATH=docs/<TICKET_KEY>.md`

   If the verdict is FAIL, stop and return `PLANNING: FAIL` with
   `Failure category: PREFLIGHT`.

3. **Stage 1 - Plan**
   Read the `task-planner` definition and dispatch it with:
   - `TICKET_KEY=<TICKET_KEY>`
   - `INPUT_PATH=docs/<TICKET_KEY>.md`
   - `OUTPUT_PATH=docs/<TICKET_KEY>-stage-1-detailed.md`
   - `DECISIONS=<DECISIONS>` only when Stage 1 is part of a re-plan
   - `VALIDATION_ISSUES=<issues list>` only when retrying Stage 1 after a
     failed validator gate

   If `PLAN` returns `FAIL`, `BLOCKED`, or `ERROR`, stop and return
   `PLANNING: FAIL` with `Failure category: STAGE_1`.

   Then validate stage 1 by reading the `stage-validator` definition and
   dispatching it with:
   - `TICKET_KEY=<TICKET_KEY>`
   - `STAGE=1`
   - `FILE_PATH=docs/<TICKET_KEY>-stage-1-detailed.md`

   If that validator returns `FAIL`, apply Step 7 before returning a phase
   failure.

4. **Stage 2 - Prioritize**
   Read the `dependency-prioritizer` definition and dispatch it with:
   - `TICKET_KEY=<TICKET_KEY>`
   - `INPUT_PATH=docs/<TICKET_KEY>-stage-1-detailed.md`
   - `OUTPUT_PATH=docs/<TICKET_KEY>-stage-2-prioritized.md`
   - `DECISIONS=<DECISIONS>` only when Stage 2 is part of a re-plan
   - `VALIDATION_ISSUES=<issues list>` only when retrying Stage 2 after a
     failed validator gate

   If `PRIORITIZATION` returns `FAIL`, `BLOCKED`, or `ERROR`, stop and return
   `PLANNING: FAIL` with `Failure category: STAGE_2`.

   Then validate stage 2 by reading the `stage-validator` definition and
   dispatching it with:
   - `TICKET_KEY=<TICKET_KEY>`
   - `STAGE=2`
   - `FILE_PATH=docs/<TICKET_KEY>-stage-2-prioritized.md`

   If that validator returns `FAIL`, apply Step 7 before returning a phase
   failure.

5. **Stage 3 - Validate**
   Read the `task-validator` definition and dispatch it with:
   - `TICKET_KEY=<TICKET_KEY>`
   - `SNAPSHOT_PATH=docs/<TICKET_KEY>.md`
   - `PLAN_PATH=docs/<TICKET_KEY>-stage-2-prioritized.md`
   - `OUTPUT_PATH=docs/<TICKET_KEY>-tasks.md`
   - `VALIDATION_ISSUES=<issues list>` only when retrying Stage 3 or repairing
     a failed post-pipeline gate

   If `TASK_VALIDATION` returns `FAIL`, `BLOCKED`, or `ERROR`, stop and return
   `PLANNING: FAIL` with `Failure category: STAGE_3`.

   Then validate stage 3 by reading the `stage-validator` definition and
   dispatching it with:
   - `TICKET_KEY=<TICKET_KEY>`
   - `STAGE=3`
   - `FILE_PATH=docs/<TICKET_KEY>-tasks.md`

   If that validator returns `FAIL`, apply Step 7 before returning a phase
   failure.

6. **Post-pipeline gate**
   Read the `stage-validator` definition and dispatch it with:
   - `TICKET_KEY=<TICKET_KEY>`
   - `STAGE=postpipeline`
   - `FILE_PATH=docs/<TICKET_KEY>-tasks.md`

   This confirms the full output contract for downstream phases.

7. **Targeted retry loop**
   This loop applies only to `STAGE_VALIDATION: FAIL` results. If a stage
   subagent returns `PLAN: FAIL`, `PRIORITIZATION: FAIL`, or
   `TASK_VALIDATION: FAIL`, stop and return `PLANNING: FAIL`.

   For any failing validator gate:
   - Collect only the validator's issues list.
   - Re-dispatch only the stage that produced that artifact.
   - Pass the original inputs plus `VALIDATION_ISSUES=<issues list>`.
   - Re-run only the previously failing validator gate.
   - If the failed gate is `postpipeline`, re-dispatch Stage 3 with
     `VALIDATION_ISSUES`, then rerun `STAGE=3` and `STAGE=postpipeline`.
   - Stop after 3 failed cycles for the same gate and return `PLANNING: FAIL`
     with the relevant failure category.

8. **Report**
   On success, return the completion handoff from `## Output Contract`. Include
   the final file path, task count, cross-cutting question count, warning count,
   and the preserved artifact paths. State explicitly that planning is complete
   and implementation has not started.
