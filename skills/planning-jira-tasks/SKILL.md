  Create an implementation task plan from a previously retrieved Jira ticket
  document. Breaks the ticket into the smallest practical set of focused,
  independent, and executable tasks. Use when the user says "plan the ticket",
  "create tasks", "break down the ticket", "create an implementation plan", or
  "plan JNS-1234". Requires that the ticket information has already been
  retrieved into docs/<TICKET_KEY>.md. This skill produces a plan ONLY — it
  does NOT implement anything.

# Planning Jira Tasks

## Purpose

Read the ticket snapshot at `docs/<TICKET_KEY>.md` and produce a detailed,
self-contained task plan at `docs/<TICKET_KEY>-tasks.md`. Each task must carry
enough local context that a future agent with zero prior knowledge can execute
it in isolation.

This skill orchestrates a **pipeline of specialized subagents**, each handling
one phase of the planning process. The main agent coordinates handoffs, manages
intermediate artifacts, and performs a final quality check.

## Inputs

| Input        | Source              | Required | Example    |
| ------------ | ------------------- | -------- | ---------- |
| `TICKET_KEY` | User / `$ARGUMENTS` | Yes      | `JNS-6065` |

The ticket snapshot file must already exist at `docs/<TICKET_KEY>.md`.
If it does not, tell the user to run the **fetching-jira-ticket** skill first.

## Output

```
docs/<TICKET_KEY>-tasks.md
```

## Subagent Pipeline

This skill uses five subagents, executed in sequence. Each subagent's output
feeds into the next. All subagent definitions live in this skill folder.

### Intermediate files

Each subagent writes to a stage file. These are working artifacts — they get
cleaned up after the final plan is written.

| Stage | File                                 | Subagent          |
| ----- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------- |
| 1     | `docs/<KEY>-stage-1-decomposed.md`   | task-decomposer   |
| 2     | `docs/<KEY>-stage-2-detailed.md`     | task-planner      |
| 3     | `docs/<KEY>-stage-3-dependencies.md` | dependency-mapper |
| 4     | `docs/<KEY>-stage-4-prioritized.md`  | task-prioritizer  |
| 5     | `docs/<KEY>-tasks.md` (final)        | task-validator    |

## Execution Steps

### 1. Pre-flight

- Verify `docs/<TICKET_KEY>.md` exists. If not, stop and tell the user.
- Read the file to confirm it follows the expected template (has `## Description`,
  `## Subtasks`, etc.).

### 2. Run the pipeline

Execute each subagent in order. After each stage, do a quick sanity check on the
output before proceeding.

#### Stage 1 — Decompose

```
agent task-decomposer "Read docs/<KEY>.md and write a decomposed task list to docs/<KEY>-stage-1-decomposed.md"
```

**Sanity check:** File exists and contains at least 2 tasks.

#### Stage 2 — Detail

```
agent task-planner "Read docs/<KEY>.md (ticket) and docs/<KEY>-stage-1-decomposed.md (task list), then write detailed tasks to docs/<KEY>-stage-2-detailed.md"
```

**Sanity check:** Every task from Stage 1 is present with all required
subsections (Objective, Implementation notes, Definition of done).

#### Stage 3 — Map dependencies

```
agent dependency-mapper "Read docs/<KEY>-stage-2-detailed.md and write dependency-annotated tasks to docs/<KEY>-stage-3-dependencies.md"
```

**Sanity check:** Every task has a `Dependencies / prerequisites` field.

#### Stage 4 — Prioritize

```
agent task-prioritizer "Read docs/<KEY>-stage-3-dependencies.md and write the prioritized plan to docs/<KEY>-stage-4-prioritized.md"
```

**Sanity check:** Tasks are renumbered in execution order. Priority rationale
is present.

#### Stage 5 — Validate

```
agent task-validator "Read docs/<KEY>.md (ticket) and docs/<KEY>-stage-4-prioritized.md (plan), then write the validated final plan to docs/<KEY>-tasks.md"
```

**Sanity check:** File exists. Validation report section is present.

### 3. Clean up intermediate files

After the final `docs/<KEY>-tasks.md` is written and passes validation:

```bash
rm -f docs/<KEY>-stage-1-decomposed.md
rm -f docs/<KEY>-stage-2-detailed.md
rm -f docs/<KEY>-stage-3-dependencies.md
rm -f docs/<KEY>-stage-4-prioritized.md
```

### 4. Report to user

Tell the user:

- File path written.
- Total number of tasks created.
- Number of open questions flagged across all tasks.
- Number of dependency chains identified.
- Any validation warnings from Stage 5.
- Remind them that no implementation has started.

## Error Handling

- If any subagent fails, do NOT proceed to the next stage. Report the failure
  to the user with the stage number and error.
- If a sanity check fails, retry the subagent ONCE with specific feedback about
  what was missing. If it fails again, stop and report.
- Intermediate files are NOT cleaned up on failure — they help with debugging.

## Task-Planning Rules (enforced across subagents)

These rules are embedded in each subagent but listed here for reference:

- Keep tasks as small, focused, and independent as possible.
- Do not combine unrelated work into a single task.
- Prefer tasks that can be started, paused, reassigned, or clarified in isolation.
- If a task depends on missing information, call that out explicitly.
- Preserve traceability: each task references which requirement(s) it addresses.
- Include enough task-local context for zero-context execution.
- Order tasks in a sensible implementation sequence.
- Split large or ambiguous tasks until they are practical and self-contained.
